          Building an Edible Garden Building a garden is a very rewarding
          experience and edible gardens in particular are a point of pride to most
          gardeners. Edible gardens can be designed to suit any style or ability
          and should always be designed in a way that is practical for the users.
          If you are new to vegetable gardening, start small and focus on growing
          a handful of crops. Visit our Growing Guides and select the Easy To
          Grow option for more information. A small raised bed is the perfect way
          to get started as it is easy to set up and maintain. Most raised beds
          can be purchased from your local hardware store or nursery and come in
          flat packs, with pieces that slot together without the use of any tools.
          Once you have the hang of gardening, you can expand your growing space
          by adding more raised beds or by starting an in-ground garden. If you
          have a small space to work with, then try container gardening, see our
          Small Scale Gardening blog in the Kitchen & Garden section for more
          information. Site selection is another important consideration as most
          edible crops require a minimum of six to eight hours of sunlight each
          day in order to crop well. A full sun position is particularly important
          for fruiting crops such as eggplant, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and
          squash varieties. If your garden is on the shady side, there is still
          plenty you can grow including a large range of herbs and leafy greens!
          Visit our Growing Guides and select the Shade Tolerant option for
          more information
